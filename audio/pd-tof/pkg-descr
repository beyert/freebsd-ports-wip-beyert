Tof is a collection of objects and abstractions covering a wide range in
functionality.

tof is written by Thomas Ouellet Fredericks around 2009. Thomas allowed me to
re-license the library, and the 3-clause BSD license seemed most appropriate in
the Puredata eco-system. Some objects however are derived from GPL licensed
source code.
