unauthorized is a library of GUI objects and a handful of objects for working
with streaming and mp3s.

This is a minor revision of an older version for Yves Degoyon's unauthorized
puredata library. The main change is that it builds easily with the wonderful
pd-lib-builder. I created this version so I could run patchers which referenced
externals in this library. No further development of this version is
anticipated.
