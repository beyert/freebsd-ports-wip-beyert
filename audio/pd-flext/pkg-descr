Flext seeks to represent a uniform programming interface for extending the most
common modular real-time audio systems Max/MSP and Pure Data (PD) with external
modules, or short externals.  These modules provide a way to tailor such a
system for one is special needs and supply additional functionality.

Source code based on flext is able to exploit most common features of the
respective real-time framework while staying completely independent of the
actual host system and platform (hardware and operating system).
