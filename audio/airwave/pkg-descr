Airwave is a wine based VST bridge, that allows for the use of
Windows 32- and 64-bit VST 2.4 audio plugins with Linux VST hosts.
Due to the use of shared memory, only one extra copying is made for
each data transfer. Airwave also uses the XEMBED protocol to
correctly embed the plugin editor into the host window.
