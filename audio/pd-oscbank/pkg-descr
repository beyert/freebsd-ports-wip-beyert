oscbank~: for additive synthesis
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a plugin (aka 'external') for Miller Pucketter's PureData
("pd"). It was written in order to synthesize sinusoidal models that
consist of hundreds of partial sinewave components.  The external takes three
control-rate parameters for each partial: index(unique), frequency, and
amplitude. It stores this information in a bank and synthesizes earch partial
by interpolating between frames.  Please see the included oscbank~-help.pd for
details.
