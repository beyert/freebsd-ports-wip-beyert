Bespoke Synth

A software modular synth that I've been building for myself since
2011, and now you can use it!

You can find the most recent builds for Mac/Windows/Linux at
http://bespokesynth.com, or in the Releases section on GitHub.

Join the Bespoke Discord for support and to discuss with the
community.
