The CICM wrapper is a C interface for Tcl/Tk and Pure Data that aims to
facilitate the creation of objects for Pure Data.  One of the main goals is the
creation of graphical user interfaces.  It also facilitates the implementation
of dynamic multi-signal processing, and improves the compatibility with Max.
