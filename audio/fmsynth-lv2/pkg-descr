fmsynth is a FM synthesizer implementation using libfmsynth, as an LV2 plugin.

Unlike most FM synth implementations in software, this FM synthesizer does not
aim to emulate or replicate a particular synth (like DX7) or FM chip.

The synth core supports:
*  Arbitrary amounts of polyphony
*  8 operators
*  No fixed "algorithms"
*  Arbitrary modulation, every operator can modulate any other operator, even
   itself
*  Arbitrary carrier selection, every operator can be a carrier
*  Sine LFO, separate LFO per voice, modulates amplitude and frequency of
   operators
*  Envelope per operator
*  Carrier stereo panning
*  Velocity sensitivity per operator
*  Mod wheel sensitivity per operator
*  Pitch bend
*  Keyboard scaling
*  Sustain, sustained keys can overlap each other for a very rich sound
*  Full floating point implementation optimized for SIMD
*  Hard real-time constraints
