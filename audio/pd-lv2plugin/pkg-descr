This is a Pd external which provides a simple LV2 host so that you can run LV2
plugins inside Pd.  The overall operation is similar to the LADSPA plugin~
external, but it works with LV2, the new Linux plugin standard.  It supports
both audio and MIDI plugins.  lv2plugin~ is based on lilv, the reference LV2
host library, so it should work with almost any LV2 plugin.
