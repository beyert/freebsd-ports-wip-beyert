JAMRouter:  JACK <-> ALSA MIDI Router v0.2.3
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

JAMRouter is a near-sample-accurate low-latency low-jitter MIDI event
router and translator, designed specifically with external hardware
in mind, with an initial emphasis on providing full MIDI support and
SysEx translation for the Roland Juno-106, and otherwise full
compatibility with practically all MIDI hardware.  JAMRouter routes
MIDI events to/from JACK MIDI software ports and MIDI hardware
supported by ALSA Raw MIDI, ALSA Sequencer, Generic Raw MIDI, and OSS
MIDI.
