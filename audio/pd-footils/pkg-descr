This project consists of Pure Data externals, written by Frank Barknecht, but
packaged by different sources.  This library is an attempt to restore these
useful libraries, ensuring that they build properly using modern tools, with an
extensive reworking of the build system of each respective project with
portability and preservation in mind.

Note that the licenses differ substantially between each project.
