Welcome to ChucK!

what is it? : Chuck is a programming language for real-time sound synthesis and
music creation. It is open-source and freely available on macOS, Windows, and
Linux. Chuck presents a unique time-based, concurrent programming model that's
precise and expressive (we call this strongly-timed), with dynamic control
rates and the ability to add and modify code on-the-fly. In addition, ChucK
supports MIDI, OpenSoundControl, HID device, and multi-channel audio. It's fun
and easy to learn, and offers composers, researchers, and performers a powerful
programming tool for building and experimenting with complex audio
synthesis/analysis programs, and real-time interactive music.

For more information, including documentation, research publications, and
community resources, please check out the ChucK website.
