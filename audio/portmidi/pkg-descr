This is the canonical release of PortMidi.

PortMidi is a computer library for real time input and output of MIDI data.
It is designed to be portable to many different operating systems. PortMidi is
part of the PortMusic project.

The MIDI support implemented in this port is derived from Raphael Graf's
patches for a sndio backend on the OpenBSD audio/portmidi port, enhanced to
detect a variable number of MIDI (umidi) devices:
