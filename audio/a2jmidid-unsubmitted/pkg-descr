This project aims to ease the usage of legacy, non JACK enabled
applications, in a JACK MIDI enabled system, when using jack2

There are two ways to use legacy ALSA sequencer applications in a
JACK MIDI system:

Automatic bridging: For every ALSA sequencer port you get one JACK
MIDI port. If an ALSA sequencer port is both an input and an output,
you get two JACK MIDI ports, one input and output. (This approach
works almost always except when the legacy ALSA sequencer application
does not create ports and/or wants to use an existing port to capture
from or playback to. Such programs are using a feature of the |alsa|
sequencer framework that allows sending and receiving MIDI events
to/from a port, without creating a connection to it.)

Static bridges: You start an application that creates one ALSA
sequencer port and one JACK MIDI port. Such a bridge is unidirectional.

a2jmidid is a daemon that implements automatic bridging.

It has two modes of operation: Running a bridge manually or as a
backgrounded D-Bus service.
