Cream Library for Pure Data

A set of PD externals for those who like vanilla... but also want some
chocolate cream.

The Cream Library uses the CICM Wrapper, developed to facilitate the creation
of signal objects and GUI widgets, offering a set of externals that improve the
user interface in Pure Data.
