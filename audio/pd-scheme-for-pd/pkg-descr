Scheme for Pd (s4pd) is an open-source external for live-coding and scripting
Pd with an embedded s7 Scheme Lisp interpreter. It is a port of most of Scheme
for Max by the same author, and enables most Scheme code to be run on either.

Features in 0.1:

*  Run code from files, and hot reload files
*  Evaluate Scheme code from Pd messages with a REPL
*  Output numbers, symbols, lists
*  Basic array i/o
*  Send messages to named receivers
*  Schedule functions with delay

Scheme-for-Pd uses s7 Scheme, an embeddable Scheme implementation by Bill
Schottstaedt at CCRMA. s7 is a minimal Scheme, with many nice features for
algorithmic composition and embedding, and is the Scheme engine used in the
Common Music algorithmic composition toolkit and the Snd audio editor. It has
keywords, Common Lisp style macros, first-class environments, thread safety,
applicative syntax, and a very straight forward FFI (foreign function
interface). Linguistically, it is mostly R4RS with some later extensions, along
with some features from Common Lisp, and is similar in many ways to Guile,
Clojure, and Janet.
