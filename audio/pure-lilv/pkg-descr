This package provides a Pure module for David Robillard's Lilv_, a library for
LV2 plugin host writers. LV2_ is the new Linux audio plugin standard (LADSPA
successor) which aims to be portable and extensible. Lilv makes it possible to
load LV2 plugins in audio and other multimedia software. It is provided as a
comprehensive and well-tested reference implementation for LV2 plugin hosts, so
that authors of multimedia software don't have to craft their own (and often
incomplete or bug-ridden) implementations of the LV2 plugin API.

This module is still under development, but we already offer operations to
retrieve information about the LV2 plugins installed on a system, and to
instantiate and run most basic plugins. Support for MIDI input and output and
handling LV2 presets and plugin state is also available. More work is still
needed in order to support more exotic event types such as transport state and
tempo changes, and any other extensions which may be required to run more
advanced plugins. We're still trying to figure these out, so if you notice
anything that's missing in the current implementation then please submit a
feature request.
