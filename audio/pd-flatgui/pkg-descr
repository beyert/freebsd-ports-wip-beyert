Flatgui is a library of GUI objects which were part of the old 'flatspace'
collection which was at some point discontinued.

Based on the project metadata, this library was originally written by Ben
Bogart, Christoph Kummerer, Frank Barknect, Guenther Geiger, Hans-Christoph
Steiner, Krzystof Czaja, Miller Puckette, Olaf Matthes and Thomas Musil.  This
repository was derived from a 2012-12-27 version in pd-extended
(externals/flatgui).

Although I am not the original author, I wish to maintain this library for
backwards compatibility with PD patches that cannot easily be switched from the
traditional knob external (in this repository) to the excellent abcknob library
in abctools, although I would still recommend abcknob highly.

As such, I wish to keep this library faithful to older versions, but with
compatibility fixes for modern versions of PD, and portability fixes for
FreeBSD, the latter of which I will soon contribute to numerous PD externals.

Also, any hypothetical architecture issues were overcome without doing
anything, as it builds and runs properly on FreeBSD 13.0-RELEASE amd64.
