This is a Pure_ "loader plugin" for Pd_, Miller Puckette's graphical dataflow
programming system for realtime multimedia applications. If you are a Pd user,
it lets you write external Pd objects in Pure, which is generally much more
convenient and a lot more fun than having to code Pd externals in a
comparatively low-level language such as C or C++. If you are a Pure user, it
provides you with an alternative way to develop and run your Pure scripts in
one of the best graphical dataflow environments available today.

Pure certainly has its own learning curve, but once mastered, it makes
programming many kinds of Pd objects a walk in the park. Its Pd interface is
convenient to use and has livecoding support, i.e., the ability to reload Pure
externals at any time while your Pd patch keeps running. Pure also offers a
comprehensive library and many interfaces to third-party software useful for
implementing Pd objects, such as Octave_ and Grame's Faust_.

But pd-pure isn't limited to just computer music and realtime multimedia
programming, which are Pd's hallmark applications. It also allows you to employ
Pd as a graphical dataflow environment for developing and testing your Pure
programs, leveraging Pd's built-in facilities for creating graphical user
interfaces for your application, while getting Pd's sophisticated realtime
multimedia capabilities for free.
