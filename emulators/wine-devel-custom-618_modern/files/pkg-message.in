Some ZFS tuning guides recommend setting KVA_PAGES=512 in your kernel
configuration.  This is incompatible with Wine.  The maximum possible
is KVA_PAGES=500, which should still be enough for ZFS.

The port also installs some of Wine's documentation which describes
additional programs that are not in the manual pages under
  %%PREFIX%%/share/doc/wine

If you enabled both of the OSS and ALSA audio backends, then you may
switch without reinstallation of wine between either using the
following two registry scripts (although winecfg cannot change the
backend, it can show the currently active audio driver):

    regedit %%PREFIX%%/share/wine/wine-oss.reg
    regedit %%PREFIX%%/share/wine/wine-alsa.reg

Note that MIDI currently only works with the ALSA sequencer API, so
it may be preferrable to enable both APIs.
