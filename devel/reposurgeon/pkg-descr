reposurgeon enables risky operations that version-control systems don't want to
let you do, such as (a) editing past comments and metadata, (b) excising
commits, (c) coalescing commits, and (d) removing files and subtrees from repo
history. The original motivation for reposurgeon was to clean up artifacts
created by repository conversions.

reposurgeon is also useful for scripting very high-quality conversions from
Subversion.  It is better than git-svn at tag lifting, automatically cleaning
up cvs2svn conversion artifacts, dealing with nonstandard repository layouts,
recognizing branch merges, handling mixed-branch commits, and generally at
coping with Subversion's many odd corner cases.  Normally Subversion repos
should be analyzed at a rate of upwards of ten thousand commits per minute,
though that rate can fall significantly on extremely large repositories.
